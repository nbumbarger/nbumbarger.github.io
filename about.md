<h1>About me</h1>
I am a long-time Geographer and Geonerd, currently taking the plunge into full-stack web development. Over the last several years, my job has involved turning satellite images and other spatial data into maps and visualizations, and I've been privileged enough to have the freedom to teach myself scripting and software development in that context. That hobby became a second passion, and in March of this year I began a full-time web development “boot camp” in order to fully embrace the software development facet of my career. Focusing on JavaScript and Ruby on Rails, the information is coming in fast and dense, and I’m loving every minute of it.

<h1>About this site</h1>
On this site, I’m going to share some of the cool techniques I pick up along the way, along with my thoughts on various aspects of web development. Because of the volume of awesome material we're learning and the pace of the course, I can’t attempt to provide a grounding in the basics. Instead, I’ll be assuming a bit of familiarity, and focusing on topics that go a little deeper or otherwise diverge from the basic material. If I think something is awesome, and it can’t be found in fundamental tutorials, I’ll make an effort to write about it here. Due to my other interests, you’ll find that many of the divergences I make will concern maps and spatial data.
