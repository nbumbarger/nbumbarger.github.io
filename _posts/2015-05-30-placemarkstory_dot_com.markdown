I recently completed my first solo project for General Assembly, which was intended to allow us to demonstrate the skills we learned over the previous 8 weeks of the program.

##Pause for reflection
Looking back, it's been quite a journey to compress into two months: from "Hello World" in Ruby, through version control, object-oriented programming, classic SQL database management, the ActiveRecord database interface, unit tests, Ruby on Rails development, JSON, APIs, JavaScript, the DOM, jQuery, object-oriented JavaScript, and AJAX techniques among many other topics. We've been learning so many advanced techniques that there was barely a day or two leftover to mention HTML or CSS.

##PlacemarkStory.com
As I write this project description, I'm able to reflect on the first 8 weeks of GA with a bit of distance because it's actually closer to week 11 at this point (and, spoiler alert: <span style="color:lightblue">General Assembly kept getting better and better</span>). After spending the project week getting the application up and running, I spent the next 1.5 weeks or so finding extra time that I never would have guessed I had, and using it to refine the project to a point that I'm now comfortable sharing online.

My intention was to develop a spatially-enabled application that had real value, and which solved a problem that was currently unaddressed in the market; in other words, something that people would use, rather than just a demonstration of my abilities. The application I came up with leverages [Mapbox.js](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox.js/api/) to support the creation of shareable slippy story maps. Users simply create a story and begin to define spatial events within it using an exceptionally easy-to-use interface. The events are used to generate a slippy map, which can be saved and shared.
